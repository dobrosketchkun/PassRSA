# PassRSA

With this script you can generate RSA key pair from passphrase and save it in PEM.

(it's basicaly rip off from some stakoverflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20483504/making-rsa-keys-from-a-password-in-python) with some improvements.)


Requirements:

* python 2.x
* [pycrypto](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycrypto)
* [cryptography](https://cryptography.io)
